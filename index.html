      <a class="week">Description</a>
      <p>

      This course provides a foundation for computing in multidimensional
      spaces, investigating the synthetic and generative potentials of
      elementary geometric constructs.  Subjects covered will include vector
      and matrix math, space partitioning, collision detection, and
      kinematics.  We will focus both on mathematical foundations and
      practical computational techniques for creating real-time 3D graphics
      via OpenGL.
      <p> Students will produce a number of investigations into the
      topics covered, culminating in a final programming project.  No
      prerequisites are required, although some basic knowledge of
      programming is assumed. The course will consist of one lecture class
      and one lab class per week.
