      This course investigates the fundamentals of Computer Graphics, with some attention to
      mathematical foundations and practical techniques for using real-time 3D graphics via
      openGL and GLSL. We will explore various topics related to computational geometry and
      visualization, including
      curves and surfaces, space-partitioning, collision detection, and kinematics.
      <p>
      Students will be required to create a final programming project as well as complete one or two
      problem sets. No prerequisites are required, although some basic knowledge of programming
      is assumed.
      <p>
      The course will consist of one lecture class and one lab class each week.
      <p>
      Week 1: Space
      <p>
      Introduction to openGL, vectors, matrices, homogenous coordinates,
      transformations,
      <p>
      Week 2: Thinking in Space (2D)
      <p>
      Convex hull algorithms, voronoi diagrams and delaunay triangulation

      <i>VideoLoop</i> & <i>VideoTextureLoop</i>: Just like the Loop example sketch for Processing's Movie library.

      which may or may not work on all platforms and may include platform specific media files. These include:
      <p>

      <i>VideoJMC</i> : a basic demo of a video player using the JMCMovie renderer.
      <p>
      <i>VideoTexture</i> : a basic demo using using the VideoGL renderer,
      allows the user to switch videos, seek within videos, set the speed of the videos
      (including backwards playback).
      <p>
      <i>VideoPoints</i> : a demo that converts the video to points. Moving the mouse up/down controls the transparency of the points; moving the mouse left/right controls the size of the points. Pressing the up/down arrow keys changes the number of points along the y axis; pressing the left/right arrow keys changes the number of points along the x axis
      <p>
      <i>VideoPointMagnifier</i> : a demo that converts the video to points. Moving the mouse controls the center of the point magnifier. See the program itself for all the keyboard options.
      <p>
      <i>VideoGrains</i> : a demo that crossfades between two videos by moving the video pixels across the screen. Uses processing's Java2D mode, which for some reason is quite slow.
      <p>
      <i>VideoTextureFade</i> : a demo that crossfades between a series of videos all playing concurrently. Controls let you change the position and playback speed of any of the videos. Includes a basic timing framework for controlling the timing of video effects, etc.
      <p>
      Please feel free to contribute to the demos section. I welcome any demonstration code or links to projects built with the jmcvideo library.

       <p>
      1)
        Place the zip file inside your local Processing "sketch" folder.
        Then unzip the jmcvideo zip and rename the file so that you have a correct
        path to the library files. For example, if you downloaded the
        "libraries_macosx" folder as "libraries" directly in your sketch directory.
        The full path will look something like this:
        <div style="margin-left:20px;">
        /Users/yourName/Documents/Processing/libraries/jmcvideo/library/
        </div>
        <br>

        This folder will contain various files, depending upon which version
        you downloaded.
        For instance, the list of files for OSX are:
        <p>
        <div style="margin-left:20px;">
          jmc.jar
        <br>
          jmcServerDaemon
        <br>
          jmcvideo.jar
        <br>
          libCoreVideoSupport.jnilib
        <br>
          libDecora-SSE.jnilib
        <br>
          libon2_decoder.jnilib
        </div>
        <p>
        I believe that all the JMC libraries are open source, so I am including them
        here for convenience. You can also get them by downloading JavaFX.
        <p>
        2)
          Add "import jmcvideo.*;" to any of your programs that use the jmcvideo library.
          See the demo sketches above for examples.
        <p>
       <a class="subtitle">issues / to do</a>
       <p>
      1) .mp4 files update slowly (at least under OS X). There seems to be an issue with how JMC handles these files, or perhaps I am not specifying the correct image format. The sound is working fine, but the frames are only being updated every 300ms on average.
      <br>
      2) the JavaFX jmc update 1.0.1 seems to break the ability to break the seek and setRate functionality!! Because I like to play videos backwards I am including the 1.0.0 version of jmc until these issues are resolved.
      <br>
      3) jmc 1.0.1 has the ability to play MPG files on OS X (which doesn't work under 1.0.0) so you can swap to that version if you need to play those files.
      <br>
      4) Only some formats have the ability to play sound backwards (.MOV and .3GP I think). The other formats will play backwards but without sound.
      <br>
      5) Streaming HD MOV files works fine, but I haven't yet completely implemented the jmc buffering strategy. It seems a little flaky.
      <br>
      6) Exporting to applet and application is not working because of two reasons I think. One is a jar signing issue, and the other is that jmc requires filenames to be converted to absolute URIs, and this might not be happening when the sketch is exported.
      <br>
      7) As far as I can tell there is no way to get direct access to the audio data to filter it, etc. The GSVideo library might be able to do this
      <br>
      8) Webcam support does not yet exist, but there are rumours that an upcoming version of
      JavaFX will include this.
